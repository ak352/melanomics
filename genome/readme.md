###Genome sequencing pipeline


* *abscnseq/dgv* - annotation of CNVs with DGV, Berger et al.,  and genes
* *align* - Short-read alignment, including using checkpointing
* *breakfast* - Fusion gene calling
* *cnv*	- binned coverage, possibly for use in Circos/POMO plots
* *extractBAM*	- Extracts subsets of BAM files
* *fastq* - decompressing fastq files
* *fastqc* - quality control on fastq reads
* *fastqc_trim* -quality control on trimmed fastq reads
* *genome_checkpointed*
* *strelka/strelka2vcf*   - Converting Strelka output to VCF with genotype field
* *sv* - Structural variants pipeline
* *test*
* *trim* - read trimming
* *variants*
* *variants2* - Pipeline after variant calling
